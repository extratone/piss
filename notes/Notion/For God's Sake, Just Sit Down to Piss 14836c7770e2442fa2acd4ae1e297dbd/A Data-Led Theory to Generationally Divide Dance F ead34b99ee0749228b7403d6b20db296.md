This is a hypothetical wedding dance floor.

The crowd on our dance floor is equally distributed by age.

Some age groups are more likely to recognize certain songs than others.

(we [collected a 3.5 million data points](https://pudding.cool/2020/04/music-challenge/) on what songs people know)

Suppose we play “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees , a song with almost universal recognition.

Playing “Get Low” by Lil Jon will draw a different crowd.

Play “Smack That” by Akon , released in 2006, and it’s your best shot at isolating people in their 20s.

“Smack That” is a generational marker, known by few people outside those who grew up with it.

Play “Cold Hearted” by Paula Abdul , released in 1988, and you can do the same thing for people in their 40s.

What if you needed a song that brings to the floor people in their 30s and 40s? There’s a Venn diagram for that.

Adding in people in their 20s, and the diagram depicts 7 songs to generationally divide (or unify) dance floors.
