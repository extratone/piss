As We May Think,Vannevar Bush,,,"Sep 13, 2020 3:42 AM","Jul 1, 1945","As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on ""The American Scholar,"" this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge.",,,,Essay,No,,,,Software History,,https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881

The Oligopoly of Academic Publishers in the Digital Era,"Philippe Mongeon, Stefanie Haustein, Vincent Larivière",,,"Nov 9, 2020 1:08 PM","Jun 10, 2015","The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the topic of much debate within and outside the scientific community, especially in relation to major publishers’ high profit margins. However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor & Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact.

Predictors of academic efficacy and dropout intention in university students: Can engagement suppress burnout?,"Hugo Assunção, João Marôco",,,"Nov 9, 2020 5:49 PM","Oct 29, 2020","In this study we modelled possible causes and consequences of student burnout and engagement on academic efficacy and dropout intention in university students. Further we asked, can student engagement protect against the effects of burnout? In total 4,061 university students from Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Finland, Serbia, and Macao SAR, Taiwan participated in this study. With the data collected we analyzed the influence of Social Support, Coping Strategies, and school/course related variables on student engagement and burnout using structural equation modeling. We also analyzed the effect of student engagement, student burnout, and their interaction, on Academic Performance and Dropout Intention. We found that both student engagement and burnout are good predictors of subjective academic performance and dropout intention. However, student burnout suppresses the effect of student engagement on these variables. This result has strong implications for practitioners and administrators. To prevent student dropout, it is not enough to promote student engagement—additionally, and importantly, levels of student burnout must be kept low. Other variables such as social support and coping strategies are also relevant predictors of student engagement and burnout and should be considered when implementing preventive actions, self-help and guided intervention programs for college students.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Predictors_of_academic_efficacy_and_dropout_intention_in_university_students.pdf,,,Web,No,,,,Academia,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239816
The brave blue world: Facebook flow and Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD),,,,"Nov 9, 2020 5:58 PM","Jul 26, 2018","The present study investigated the relationship between flow experienced when using Facebook (Facebook flow; i.e., experience of intensive enjoyment and pleasure generated by Facebook use due to which the Facebook activity is continued even at high costs of this behavior) and Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD). In a sample of 398 Facebook users (age: M (SD) = 33.01 (11.23), range: 18–64), the significant positive association between Facebook flow and FAD was positively moderated by the intensity of Facebook use. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that all six items assessing FAD loaded on the same factor as two items belonging to the subscale telepresence of Facebook flow. Therefore, the close link between Facebook flow and FAD may in particular result from the immersion in an attractive online world created by Facebook, where users escape to forget their everyday obligations and problems. Present results provide first evidence that Facebook flow may be an anteceded of FAD and indicate the mechanisms that may contribute to its development and maintenance. Practical applications for future studies and limitations of present results are discussed.",,,,Web,No,,,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201484
"I Like, I Cite? Do Facebook Likes Predict the Impact of Scientific Work?",,,,"Nov 9, 2020 6:02 PM","Aug 5, 2015","Due to the increasing amount of scientific work and the typical delays in publication, promptly assessing the impact of scholarly work is a huge challenge. To meet this challenge, one solution may be to create and discover innovative indicators. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether Facebook likes for unpublished manuscripts that are uploaded to the Internet could be used as an early indicator of the future impact of the scientific work. To address our research question, we compared Facebook likes for manuscripts uploaded to the Harvard Business School website (Study 1) and the bioRxiv website (Study 2) with traditional impact indicators (journal article citations, Impact Factor, Immediacy Index) for those manuscripts that have been published as a journal article. Although based on our full sample of Study 1 (N = 170), Facebook likes do not predict traditional impact indicators, for manuscripts with one or more Facebook likes (n = 95), our results indicate that the more Facebook likes a manuscript receives, the more journal article citations the manuscript receives. In additional analyses (for which we categorized the manuscripts as psychological and non-psychological manuscripts), we found that the significant prediction of citations stems from the psychological and not the non-psychological manuscripts. In Study 2, we observed that Facebook likes (N = 270) and non-zero Facebook likes (n = 84) do not predict traditional impact indicators. Taken together, our findings indicate an interdisciplinary difference in the predictive value of Facebook likes, according to which Facebook likes only predict citations in the psychological area but not in the non-psychological area of business or in the field of life sciences. Our paper contributes to understanding the possibilities and limits of the use of social media indicators as potential early indicators of the impact of scientific work.",,,,Web,No,,,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134389

Religious Devices: A Survey of Technologies of Worship.,Hugh Davies,,,"Nov 10, 2020 3:05 AM","Mar 24, 2019","Responding to the unannounced spiritual mysticism surrounding contemporary technologies, a religiosity present in the prayer-like devotion of social media piety to the cultish intensity surrounding each iPhone launch, this paper aims to dispel presumptions of the spiritual in opposition to the technological by surveying a range of media devices specifically developed for religious purposes. More than connecting scholarship in technology, media and religion, this survey recommends a new arc in the cultural examination of technology. As curious media artefacts, religious devices are independently worthy of study but they also offer a material past to the so-called “religion of Silicon Valley” as well as providing insight to the rituals, superstitions and beliefs of technology users. While recent shifts in religious studies have propelled the field toward computer-mediated communication, this study moves beyond sociological and anthropological concerns to examine the hardware and software of spiritual technologies, thereby connecting the media turn in religious studies with the material turn in media studies.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Religious_Devices_A_Survey_of_Technologies_of_Worship_-_communication__1.pdf,,,Web,No,,communication +1,,Media,"Big Blue, Editorial, Media, Publishing",https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cpo/vol7/iss2/5/

Dealing with digital intermediaries: A case study of the relations between publishers and platforms,"Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, Sarah Anne Ganter",,,"Nov 10, 2020 10:25 AM","Apr 17, 2017","The rise of digital intermediaries such as search engines and social media is profoundly changing our media environment. Here, we analyze how news media organizations handle their relations to these increasingly important intermediaries. Based on a strategic case study, we argue that relationships between publishers and platforms are characterized by a tension between (1) short-term, operational opportunities and (2) long-term strategic worries about becoming too dependent on intermediaries. We argue that these relationships are shaped by news media’s fear of missing out, the difficulties of evaluating the risk/reward ratios, and a sense of asymmetry. The implication is that news media that developed into an increasingly independent institution in the 20th century—in part enabled by news media organizations’ control over channels of communication—are becoming dependent upon new digital intermediaries that structure the media environment in ways that not only individual citizens but also large, resource-rich, powerful organizations have to adapt to.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Dealing_with_digital_intermediaries_-_A_case_study_of_the_relations_between_publishers_and_platforms.pdf,,"Kleis Nielsen, Rasmus, and Sarah Anne Ganter. “Dealing with Digital Intermediaries: A Case Study of the Relations between Publishers and Platforms.” New Media & Society, vol. 20, no. 4, Apr. 2018, pp. 1600–1617, doi:10.1177/1461444817701318.",Digital Journal,No,,New Media & Society,,"Media, Social Media","Big Blue, Media, Social",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444817701318
Facebook’s evolution: development of a platform-as-infrastructure,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/24701475.2019.1593667,"Nov 10, 2020 10:42 AM","May 1, 2019","The purpose of this article is to operationalise an evolutionary perspective on the history of social media and to trace Facebook’s evolution from a social networking site to a “platform-as-infrastructure”. Social media platforms such as Facebook change constantly on the level of their platform architectures, interfaces, governance frameworks, and control mechanisms, all while responding to their larger environments. By examining the evolution of Facebook’s programmability and corporate partnerships, we develop an empirical historical analysis of the platform’s boundary dynamics that ultimately determine its operational scale and scope. Based on our analysis of a unique set of archived primary sources, we discern four main stages in Facebook’s long-term evolution and discuss the interplay between ongoing processes of “platformisation” and “infrastructuralisation”. We argue that these terms foreground complementary aspects of the platform’s efforts in balancing its expansion and adaptability to changing user needs and other “environmental dynamics” without risking its integrations and embedding in other domains, such as advertising, marketing, and publishing. Ultimately, our contribution illustrates how empirical platform histories can denaturalise the current dominant position of social media platforms, such as Facebook, revealing over a decade of incremental evolution rather than revolution.","Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Facebooks_evolution_development_of_a_platform-as-infrastructure.pdf, Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Facebooks_evolution_development_of_a_platform-as-infrastructure.html, Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/REFERENCES_-_Facebooks_evolution_development_of_a_platform-as-infrastructure.csv",,"Helmond, Anne, David B.

Following recent debates on data colonialism, it argues that Facebook dialectically assumes a role of a new archon of public records, while being unarchivable by design. It then puts forward counter-archiving – a practice developed to resist the epistemic hegemony of colonial archives – as a method that allows the critical study of the social media platform, after it had shut down researcher’s access to public data through its application programming interface. After defining and justifying counter-archiving as a method for studying datafied platforms, two counter-archives are presented as proof of concept.

Involuntary childlessness online: Digital lifelines through blogs and Instagram,Kristina Stenström,,,"Nov 15, 2020 9:30 PM","Oct 26, 2020","Platformed sociality has become an elemental part of existential processes and struggles. Previous research has shown that digital contexts offer lifelines of support and a sense of belonging based on shared vulnerabilities. By combining phenomenological and ethnographic approaches, this article explores involuntary childlessness (IC) online in so-called trying-to-conceive (TTC) contexts on Instagram and in blogs. The analysis is driven by the following questions: What are the particularities of digital lifeline communication in the context of IC? Can lifeline communication shape what is coming into being in the context of wished-for children and/or motherhood? Can (digital) life be challenged, extended, or created in this context? Drawing on interviews and online posts from 260 Instagram accounts and three blogs, I argue that digital lifeline communication in TTC environments facilitates digital existence and “digital life” as the notions of motherhood and longed-for and lost children attain a form of digital materiality through posts and discussions.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Involuntary_childlessness_online_-_Kristina_Stenstrm.pdf,,"Stenström, Kristina. “Involuntary Childlessness Online: Digital Lifelines through Blogs and Instagram.” New Media & Society, Oct. 2020, doi:10.1177/1461444820968907.",Digital Journal,No,,New Media & Society,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444820968907
Deplatforming: Following extreme Internet celebrities to Telegram and alternative social media,Richard Rogers,,,"Nov 15, 2020 9:42 PM","May 6, 2020","Extreme, anti-establishment actors are being characterized increasingly as ‘dangerous individuals’ by the social media platforms that once aided in making them into ‘Internet celebrities’. These individuals (and sometimes groups) are being ‘deplatformed’ by the leading social media companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube for such offences as ‘organised hate’. Deplatforming has prompted debate about ‘liberal big tech’ silencing free speech and taking on the role of editors, but also about the questions of whether it is effective and for whom. The research reported here follows certain of these Internet celebrities to Telegram as well as to a larger alternative social media ecology. It enquires empirically into some of the arguments made concerning whether deplatforming ‘works’ and how the deplatformed use Telegram. It discusses the effects of deplatforming for extreme Internet celebrities, alternative and mainstream social media platforms and the Internet at large. It also touches upon how social media companies’ deplatforming is affecting critical social media research, both into the substance of extreme speech as well as its audiences on mainstream as well as alternative platforms.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Deplatforming_-_Following_extreme_Internet_celebrities_to_Telegram_and_alternative_social_media_-_Richard_Rogers.pdf,,"Rogers, Richard. “Deplatforming: Following Extreme Internet Celebrities to Telegram and Alternative Social Media.” European Journal of Communication, vol. 35, no. 3, June 2020, pp. 213–229, doi:10.1177/0267323120922066.",Digital Journal,No,,European Journal of Communication,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0267323120922066

Follow the “mastodon”: Structure and evolution of a decentralized online social network,"Gian Paolo Rossi, Matteo Zignani, Sabrina Gaito",,,"Nov 15, 2020 10:03 PM","Sep 26, 2018","In this paper we present a dataset containing both the network of the “follow” relationships and its growth in terms of new connections and users, all which we obtained by mining the decentralized online social network named Mastodon. The dataset is combined with usage statistics and meta-data (geographical location and allowed topics) about the servers comprising the platform-s architecture. These server are called instances. The paper also analyzes the overall structure of the Mastodon social network, focusing on its diversity w.r.t. other commercial microblogging platforms such as Twitter. Finally, we investigate how the instance-like paradigm influences the connections among the users. The newest and fastest-growing microblogging platform, Mastodon is set to become a valid alternative to established platforms like Twitter. The interest in Mastodon is mainly motivated as follows: a) the platform adopts an advertisement and recommendation-free business model; b) the decentralized architecture makes it possible to shift the control over user contents and data from the platform to the users; c) it adopts a community-like paradigm from both user and architecture viewpoints. In fact, Mastodon is composed of interconnected communities, placed on different servers; in addition, each single instance, with specific topics and languages, is independently owned and moderated. The released dataset paves the way to a number of research activities, which range from classic social network analysis to the modeling of social network dynamics and platform adoption in the early stage of the service. This data would also enable community detection validation since each instance hinges on specific topics and, lastly, the study of the interplay between the physical architecture of the platform and the social network it supports.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Follow_the_Mastodon_-_Structure_and_Evolution_of_a_Decentralized_Online_Social_Network.pdf,,"Zignani, Matteo, Sabrina Gaito, and Gian Paolo Rossi.

"Rethinking the ‘Social’ in ‘Social Media’: Insights into Topology, Abstraction, and Scale on the Mastodon Social Network",,,,"Nov 15, 2020 10:09 PM","May 15, 2020","Online interactions are often understood through the corporate social media (CSM) model where social interactions are determined through layers of abstraction and centralization that eliminate users from decision-making processes. This study demonstrates how alternative social media (ASM)—namely Mastodon—restructure the relationship between the technical structure of social media and the social interactions that follow, offering a particular type of sociality distinct from CSM. Drawing from a variety of qualitative data, this analysis finds that 1) the decentralized structure of Mastodon enables community autonomy, 2) Mastodon’s open-source protocol allows the internal and technical development of the site to become a social enterprise in and of itself, and 3) Mastodon’s horizontal structure shifts the site’s scaling focus from sheer number of users to quality engagement and niche communities.

In the Mastodon model, users can run their own nodes, and other users can connect to them. You can follow users whose accounts reside in other nodes.

It argues that scrapbooks and social media can be conceptualized as sites of personal media assemblage and personal media archives, a designation that highlights the simultaneously social and archival dimensions of each form. After discussing these formal similarities, the author identifies three shared functions: (1) documenting friendship, (2) navigating new media abundance, and (3) communicating taste and building cultural capital. By drawing functional and formal parallels between the two media, the goal is to observe how these ‘old’ and ‘new’ technologies might mutually shed light on each other’s neglected social and archival dimensions, offering scholars a wider range of angles from which to approach them as cultural and biographical texts.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/From_scrapbook_to_Facebook_-_A_history_of_personal_media_assemblage_and_archives.pdf,,"Good, Katie Day.

Social Media Definition and the Governance Challenge: An Introduction to the Special Issue,,,,"Nov 16, 2020 3:15 AM","Jul 22, 2015","This introduction to a special issue of ""Telecommunications Policy"" entitled ""The Governance of Social Media"" begins with a definition of social media that informs all contributions in the special issue. A section describing the challenges associated with the governance of social media is presented next, followed by an overview of the various articles included in the special issue.
While the Internet and the World Wide Web have always been used to facilitate social interaction, the emergence and rapid diffusion of Web 2.0 functionalities during the first decade of the new millennium enabled an evolutionary leap forward in the social component of web use. This and falling costs for online data storage made it feasible for the first time to offer masses of Internet users access to an array of user-centric spaces they could populate with user-generated content, along with a correspondingly diverse set of opportunities for linking these spaces together to form virtual social networks.
To define “social media” for our current purposes, we synthesize definitions presented in the literature and identify the following commonalities among current social media services:
1) Social media services are (currently) Web 2.0 Internet-based applications,
2) User-generated content is the lifeblood of social media,
3) Individuals and groups create user-specific profiles for a site or app designed and maintained by a social media service,
4) Social media services facilitate the development of social networks online by connecting a profile with those of other individuals and/or groups.
Transformative communication technologies have always called for regulatory innovation. Theodor Vail’s vision of “one policy, one system, universal service” preceded more than one-hundred years of innovative regulations aimed at connecting all Americans to a single telephone network. The sinking of the Titanic, caused in part by “chaos in the spectrum” led to the Radio Act of 1912 and the creation of a command and control model designed to regulate broadcast radio. Safe-harbor hours were put in place after a father and son heard George Carlin’s “seven dirty words” routine over the radio in their car. The fairness doctrine and the minority tax certificate program were designed to address inequalities in the broadcast television industry. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act responded to intellectual property concerns raised by a global Internet and the FCC’s 700mhz auction was the result of demand for smarter mobile phones. Now we must consider the role of regulatory innovation in response to the emergence of social media.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Social_Media_Definition_and_the_Governance_Challenge_An_Introduction_to_the_Special_Issue.pdf,,"Obar, Jonathan A., and Steven S.

There is a rapid takeover of traditional publishers’ roles by companies including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, and Twitter that shows no sign of slowing, and which raises serious questions over how the costs of journalism will be supported. These companies have evolved beyond their role as distribution channels, and now control what audiences see and who gets paid for their attention, and even what format and type of journalism flourishes.
Publishers are continuing to push more of their journalism to third-party platforms despite no guarantee of consistent return on investment. Publishing is no longer the core activity of certain journalism organizations. This trend will continue as news companies give up more of the traditional functions of publishers.
This report, part of an ongoing study by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, charts the convergence between journalism and platform companies. In the span of 20 years, journalism has experienced three significant changes in business and distribution models: the switch from analog to digital, the rise of the social web, and now the dominance of mobile.

BCOSN: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Online Social Network - IEEE Journals & Magazine,,,,"Nov 18, 2020 2:09 AM","Oct 2, 2019","Online social networks (OSNs) are becoming more and more prevalent in people's life, but they face the problem of privacy leakage due to the centralized data management mechanism. The emergence of distributed OSNs (DOSNs) can solve this privacy issue, yet they bring inefficiencies in providing the main functionalities, such as access control and data availability. In this article, in view of the above-mentioned challenges encountered in OSNs and DOSNs, we exploit the emerging blockchain technique to design a new DOSN framework that integrates the advantages of both traditional centralized OSNs and DOSNs. By combining smart contracts, we use the blockchain as a trusted server to provide central control services. Meanwhile, we separate the storage services so that users have complete control over their data. In the experiment, we use real-world data sets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",,,,,No,,,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Federated Social, Media, Social",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8855083
Rumor Identification in Microblogging Systems Based on Users’ Behavior - IEEE Journals & Magazine,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2016.2517458,"Nov 18, 2020 2:13 AM","Sep 18, 2015","In recent years, microblog systems such as Twitter and Sina Weibo have averaged multimillion active users. On the other hand, the microblog system has become a new means of rumor-spreading platform. In this paper, we investigate the machine-learning-based rumor identification approaches. We observed that feature design and selection has a stronger impact on the rumor identification accuracy than the selection of machine-learning algorithms. Meanwhile, the rumor publishers' behavior may diverge from normal users', and a rumor post may have different responses from a normal post. However, mass behavior on rumor posts has not been explored adequately. Hence, we investigate rumor identification schemes by applying five new features based on users' behaviors, and combine the new features with the existing well-proved effective user behavior-based features, such as followers' comments and reposting, to predict whether a microblog post is a rumor. Experiment results on real-world data from Sina Weibo demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed method and features. From the experiments, we conclude that the rumor detection based on mass behaviors is more effective than the detection based on microblogs' inherent features.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Rumor_Identification_in_Microblogging_Systems_Based_on_Users_Behavior.pdf,,"G.

"Forwarding Behavior Prediction Based on Microblog User Features ",,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2995411,"Nov 18, 2020 2:17 AM","May 18, 2020","In microblog networks, when a user posts a microblog, other users may forward the post, and then the forwarding process will bring about the rapid dissemination and diffusion of information. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and novel approach to predict user forwarding behavior. Firstly, we build the feature sets that affect the microblog forwarding, such as interest topic,geographic location, user aggregation coefficient,neighborhood overlap and so on. These features are classified into four categories: user characteristics, microblog features, network structure features, and interactive behavior characteristics. Secondly, we establish a feature selection model based on Filtering and Wrapping for predicting the forwarding behavior of users. The model includes three aspects: (1)ANOVA(Analysis of variance): The value of each feature is analyzed by variance analysis. If the feature variance is small, the feature provides less information. (2)$\chi ^{2}$ test and point-two-column correlation analysis: They filter discrete and continuous features, respectively. (3)Wrapper analysis: In order to solve the strong correlations between the features, we use LVW(Las vagas wrapper) algorithm to analyze the above feature sets, and then obtain the optimal feature combination. Finally, we propose the forwarding prediction model based on AdaBoost(Adaptive boosting) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has the highest precision and F1 score than Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM(Support vector machine), and the F1 score reached 0.885. Among different topics, our proposed AdaBoost prediction model has good recall and F1 scores for different topics. In addition, by using different feature sets for comparison experiments, it is found that the optimal features selected in this paper are very effective.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Forwarding_Behavior_Prediction_Based_on_Microblog_User_Features.pdf,,"C.

Hate Speech on Twitter: A Pragmatic Approach to Collect Hateful and Offensive Expressions and Perform Hate Speech Detection - IEEE Journals & Magazine,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2806394,"Nov 18, 2020 2:25 AM","Feb 15, 2018","With the rapid growth of social networks and microblogging websites, communication between people from different cultural and psychological backgrounds has become more direct, resulting in more and more “cyber”conflicts between these people. Consequently, hate speech is used more and more, to the point where it has become a serious problem invading these open spaces. Hate speech refers to the use of aggressive, violent or offensive language, targeting a specific group of people sharing a common property, whether this property is their gender (i.e., sexism), their ethnic group or race (i.e., racism) or their believes and religion. While most of the online social networks and microblogging websites forbid the use of hate speech, the size of these networks and websites makes it almost impossible to control all of their content. Therefore, arises the necessity to detect such speech automatically and filter any content that presents hateful language or language inciting to hatred. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect hate expressions on Twitter. Our approach is based on unigrams and patterns that are automatically collected from the training set. These patterns and unigrams are later used, among others, as features to train a machine learning algorithm. Our experiments on a test set composed of 2010 tweets show that our approach reaches an accuracy equal to 87.4% on detecting whether a tweet is offensive or not (binary classification), and an accuracy equal to 78.4% on detecting whether a tweet is hateful, offensive, or clean (ternary classification).",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Hate_Speech_on_Twitter_-_A_Pragmatic_Approach_to_Collect_Hateful_and_Offensive_Expressions_and_Perform_Hate_Speech_Detection.pdf,,"H.

Social Recommendation With Multiple Influence From Direct User Interactions - IEEE Journals & Magazine,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2739752,"Nov 18, 2020 2:29 AM","Aug 15, 2017","With the sustained development of social networks, increasing attention has been paid to social recommender systems. Current studies usually focus on indirect factors such as the similarity between users, but multiple direct interactions, such as mentions, reposts, and comments, are seldom considered. This paper addresses direct connections between users in social recommender systems. We analyze direct interactions to investigate the connection strength between users, and then, user preferences and item characteristics can be better described. Based on the analysis of social influence between users and users' influence over the whole social network, we propose a recommendation method with social influence, which makes full use of information among users in social networks and introduces the mechanisms of macroscopic and microscopic influences. Direct interactions between users are incorporated into a matrix factorization objective function. Real-world microblog data are applied to verify our model, and the results show that the proposed recommendation method outperforms other state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Social_Recommendation_With_Multiple_Influence_From_Direct_User_Interactions.pdf,,"C.

Extracting Deep Personae Social Relations in Microblog Posts - IEEE Journals & Magazine,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960659,"Nov 18, 2020 2:31 AM","Dec 18, 2019","Numerous studies have been conducted to extract relationships from different documents. However, extracting relationships from microblog posts is rarely studied. In this paper, we improve a novel kernel-based learning algorithm to mine the personae social relationships from microblog posts by combining the syntax and semantic meanings of the dependency trigram kernels (DTK). To deeply extract the personal social relationships of microblog posts, we define the relation feature words, provide seven rules for extracting these feature words, and propose a rule-based approach that mines these relation feature words from microblog posts. We construct relation feature word dictionaries for different relation types because of the lack of prominent relation features in microblog posts. We propose an algorithm to classify relation feature words by considering two features of the relation feature words, namely, syntax and semantic similarities between relation feature words in microblog posts and by using relation feature word dictionaries. Experimental results show that the average recall, precision, and F-measure of our proposed approach outperforms the original DTK in sentence selection, personae social relation extraction, and personae social relation classification. Finally, the relation graphs of five topics clarify that our proposed approach is effective for extracting personae social relations from microblog posts.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Extracting_Deep_Personae_Social_Relations_in_Microblog_Posts.pdf,,"Y.

IPAM: Information Privacy Assessment Metric in Microblogging Online Social Networks - IEEE Journals & Magazine,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932899,"Nov 18, 2020 2:32 AM","Aug 2, 2019","A large amount of sensitive data is transferred, stored, processed, and analyzed daily in Online Social Networks (OSNs). Thus, an effective and efficient evaluation of the privacy level provided in such services is necessary to meet user expectations and comply with the requirement of the applicable laws and regulations. Several prior works have proposed mechanisms for evaluating and calculating privacy scores in OSNs. However, current models are system-specific and assess privacy only from the user's perspective. There is still a lack of a universal model that can quantify the level of privacy and compare between different systems. In this paper, we propose a generic framework to (i) guide the development of privacy metrics and (ii) to measure and assess the privacy level of OSNs, more specifically microblogging systems. The present study develops an algorithmic model to compute privacy scores based on the impact of privacy and security requirements, accessibility, and difficulty of information extraction. The proposed framework aims to provide users as well as system providers with a measure of how much the investigated system is protecting privacy. It allows also comparing the privacy protection level between different systems. The privacy score framework has been tested using real microblogging social networks and the results show the potential of the proposed privacy scoring framework.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/IPAM_-_Information_Privacy_Assessment_Metric_in_Microblogging_Online_Social_Networks.pdf,,"S.

Platforms and Publishers: The End of an Era | Academic Commons,,,https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-sc1s-2j58,"Nov 18, 2020 2:54 AM","Feb 17, 2020","Since our last report was published in June 2018, the shift in the journalism landscape has been seismic. Advertising revenues have continued to plummet and newsrooms across the country have experienced mass layoffs. In turn, publishers have scrambled to adapt their business models and priorities in an ever-changing and volatile media ecosystem—one still dominated by platforms despite the large-scale public reckoning with their effects on society and democracy.
There is no telling how publishers will fare in the coming years as platforms undergo perhaps their most dramatic transformations since their foray into publishing products in 2015. However, one thing is certain: Despite facing increasing antitrust scrutiny and calls for regulation, platforms are more powerful than ever. Over time, they have come to control the online information ecosystem and, increasingly, in the case of Facebook and Google, are among the news industry’s top funders.
It is in this context that many of the publishing executives and employees we interviewed described the “end of an era.” But as is clear in the report, this does not mean the end of their cooperation with platforms. It refers, rather, to the end of optimism that scale and ad-based platform products will bring about meaningful revenue and audience growth. From the rise of paywalls and reader revenue initiatives to the diversification of revenue streams through live events and podcasts, publishers are attempting to regain control over the future of their businesses.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Platforms_and_Publishers_-_The_End_of_an_Era_-_CJR.pdf,,,Digital Journal,No,,Columbia Journalism Review,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-sc1s-2j58

Even so, the external forces of civic and regulatory pressure are hastening a convergence between the two fields at an accelerated rate beyond what we saw when we published our first report from this study, “The Platform Press: How Silicon Valley Reengineered Journalism,” in March 2017. Journalism has played a critical part in pushing for accountability into the practices of companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, yet newsrooms are increasingly oriented toward understanding and leveraging platforms as part of finding a sustainable future.
In the latest phase of our multi-year research into the relationship between platforms and publishers, we found that despite negative rhetoric and sentiment in newsrooms toward technology companies, there is a rapid and ongoing merging in the functions of publishers and platforms, and an often surprisingly high level of involvement from platform companies in influencing news production.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Friend_and_Foe_-_The_Platform_Press_at_the_Heart_of_Journalism_-_CJR.pdf,,,Digital Journal,No,,Columbia Journalism Review,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-15pq-x415
"The Digital Public Square: Understanding the Dynamics of Data, Platforms, and News",Thomas Edward Glaisyer,,https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-3yvd-ee64,"Nov 18, 2020 3:12 AM","Feb 7, 2019","This dissertation examines the nature of the American digital public square in the 2010’s, a place where people learn about and come together to discuss matters of public concern. The newly digital public square is a key component of any functional democracy in the twenty-first century. The dissertation seeks to shed light, not only on the capacities of today’s news media institutions to produce and efficaciously distribute news and information and support a capacity for discussion and deliberation that provides a “public intelligence” on matters of concern, but also on the newly enlarged role of the public in new rituals of digestion of such news.
The work draws upon multiple systems-focused analyses of the public square, interviews, and analyses of news production, the economics and dynamics facing those who both produce and distribute news, and the broader literature about and studies of the public square.
Despite the manifest uncertainty regarding how journalism will be supported and the success of a politics where rhetoric is often untethered to the truth, a temptation still exists to see the changes to the public square in a piecemeal fashion and to assume the institutions, business models, and practices of the future will be minor modifications on or variations of the past. Much scholarship concludes that the patterns of decay and growth in this area will eventually generate equilibria in terms of press freedom, news production, news distribution, and engagement that are familiar, no less efficacious than, and only marginally distinct from those of the latter half of the twentieth century. In his book The Marketplace of Attention, Professor James Webster concludes that “the cultural ballast provided by the old media will remain with us,” and that polarizing forces will meet their match with the forces that concentrate public attention (Webster 2016).
In contrast, this dissertation argues that the combination of forces acting upon the digital public square and its emergent dynamics in the late 2010s means it is already functioning in a qualitatively different manner than the largely analogue public square of the past and, as structured, it is increasingly failing to serve individuals, groups, communities, the public writ large, and most importantly our democratic processes. This argument is built on insights from my nearly a decade of work in the media reform community—specifically, from three systems analyses I developed leading the Public Square Program at the Democracy Fund of the dynamics surrounding civic engagement and the production of local news, the dynamics of audience attention, and public trust and press freedom. After making the case for the difference that already exists, the dissertation argues that, without engagement of a wide range of actors (civic, political, and commercial) in support of much-needed changes to institutions, along with policies that will support a renewal of civic media and a focus on new practices more appropriate for the rituals of the digitally and data-infused world we live in, it is entirely possible the public square will fail to adequately support democratic ends. The dissertation concludes with recommendations to avoid this outcome.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/The_Digital_Public_Square_-_Understanding_the_Dynamics_of_Data_Platforms_and_News.pdf,,,Digital Journal,No,,Columbia Journalism Review,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-3yvd-ee64

What sets the current phase of collaboration apart from previous ones is the wide diffusion of networked forms of organization and production, and the transformative impact of these cooperative practices in reshaping the new media world and its under- lying social and technological infrastructure as public utilities.
This report explores the gradual development of this phenomenon and the related development of a new commons for journalism, or a collection of shared resources and communities reconfiguring the material and cultural conditions of newswork as a social practice subject to dilemmas that require cooperation. The journalism commons, often going unrecognized in the academic and public discourse on the future of media, offers a framework to make sense of the new schemes of human relations, production, and governance.",,,,Digital Journal,No,,,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D87D4B74

Evaluating the End-User Experience of Private Browsing Mode,,,,"Nov 24, 2020 2:21 AM","Jun 3, 2019","Nowadays, all major web browsers have a private browsing mode. However, the
mode's benefits and limitations are not particularly understood. Through the
use of survey studies, prior work has found that most users are either unaware
of private browsing or do not use it. Further, those who do use private
browsing generally have misconceptions about what protection it provides.
However, prior work has not investigated \emph{why} users misunderstand the
benefits and limitations of private browsing. In this work, we do so by
designing and conducting a three-part study: (1) an analytical approach
combining cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation to inspect the user
interface of private mode in different browsers; (2) a qualitative,
interview-based study to explore users' mental models of private browsing and
its security goals; (3) a participatory design study to investigate why
existing browser disclosures, the in-browser explanations of private browsing
mode, do not communicate the security goals of private browsing to users.
Participants critiqued the browser disclosures of three web browsers: Brave,
Firefox, and Google Chrome, and then designed new ones. We find that the user
interface of private mode in different web browsers violates several
well-established design guidelines and heuristics. Further, most participants
had incorrect mental models of private browsing, influencing their
understanding and usage of private mode. Additionally, we find that existing
browser disclosures are not only vague, but also misleading. None of the three
studied browser disclosures communicates or explains the primary security goal
of private browsing. Drawing from the results of our user study, we extract a
set of design recommendations that we encourage browser designers to validate,
in order to design more effective and informative browser disclosures related
to private mode.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/SpeedReader_-_Reader_Mode_Made_Fast_and_Private.pdf,,,Digital Journal,No,,,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08460

Transitions in Journalism—Toward a Semantic-Oriented Technological Framework,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/journalmedia1010001,"Nov 24, 2020 6:29 AM","Jul 16, 2020","The technologies behind today&rsquo;s web services, tools, and applications are evolving continually. As a result, the workflows and methods of different business sectors are undergoing constant change. The news industry and journalism are heavily affected by these changes. New technological means for practicing journalism and producing news items are being incorporated in media workflows, challenging well established journalistic norms and practices. The perpetual technological evolution of the web creates a wide range of opportunities. For this reason, both technology companies and media organizations have begun to experiment with semantic web technologies. Our focus in this paper was to discover and define the ways that semantic technologies can contribute to the technological upgrade of everyday journalism. From this perspective, we introduced the term &lsquo;semantic journalism&rsquo; and attempted to investigate the transition of journalism to a semantic-oriented technological framework.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Transitions_in_JournalismToward_a_Semantic-Oriented_Technological_Framework.pdf,,,Web,Yes,,,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://www.mdpi.com/2673-5172/1/1/1/htm

A prevalent cause for the evolution of user interests is the influence of their social circle. In general, when the interests are not known, online algorithms that explore the recommendation space while also exploiting observed preferences are preferable. We present online recommendation algorithms rooted in the linear multi-armed bandit literature. Our bandit algorithms are tailored precisely to recommendation scenarios where user interests evolve under social influence. In particular, we show that our adaptations of the classic LinREL and Thompson Sampling algorithms maintain the same asymptotic regret bounds as in the non-social case. We validate our approach experimentally using both synthetic and real datasets.",,,,,No,,,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bandits-Under-The-Influence-(Extended-Version)-Maniu-Ioannidis/0f698a7a7a21c7b7b9fa21234c1bd1cf50e4a323

As in human beings, despotism and egalitarian societies seem to also exist in animals. While studies have shown that social networks constrain many phenomena from amoebae to primates, we still do not know how consensus emerges from the properties of social networks in many biological systems. We created artificial social networks that represent the continuum from centralized to decentralized organization and used an agent-based model to make predictions about the patterns of consensus and collective movements we observed according to the social network. These theoretical results showed that different social networks and especially contrasted ones – star network vs. equal network - led to totally different patterns. Our model showed that, by moving from a centralized network to a decentralized one, the central individual seemed to lose its leadership in the collective movement's decisions. We, therefore, showed a link between the type of social network and the resulting consensus. By comparing our theoretical data with data on five groups of primates, we confirmed that this relationship between social network and consensus also appears to exist in animal societies.",,,,,No,,,,Social Media,"Big Blue, Media, Social",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032566

Communities of innovation: Cyborganic and the birth of networked social media,Jennifer Catharine Cool,,,"Nov 24, 2020 11:48 PM","Dec 4, 2008","Cyborganic, the subject of this study, was a community whose members brought Wired magazine online; launched Hotwired, the first ad-supported online magazine; set-up Web production for CNET; led the open source Apache project; and staffed and started dozens of other Internet firms and projects -- from Craig's List to Organic Online -- during the first phase of the Web's development as a popular platform (1993-1999). As a conscious project to build a hybrid community both online and on-ground, Cyborganic's central premise was that mediated and face-to-face interaction are mutually sustaining and can be used together to build uniquely robust communities. Cyborganic was also an Internet start-up and the business project provided both impetus and infrastructure for the community. The social forms and cultural practices developed in this milieu figured in the initial development of Web publishing, and prefigured Web 2.0 in online collaboration, collective knowledge creation, and social networking.; The objectives of this dissertation are several. The first is to demonstrate the role of Cyborganic in the innovation and adoption of networked social media through an ethnographic case study of the group, showing it as exemplary of the regional and cultural advantage of ""technopoles"" and as precursor to contemporary phenomena of online social networking. The second objective is to interrogate the relation between entrepreneurial and utopian practices and social imaginaries in the Cyborganic project, identifying not only their synergies, but also their tensions. Finally, my third objective is to ground celebratory and utopian discourses of new media genealogically, showing that the social media heralded today as ""revolutionary"" grew from earlier practices of personal computing, multimedia, and telecommunity similarly hailed as revolutionary in their day. Rather than representing rupture with the past, the narrative of social revolution through technologies is a cultural legacy that has passed through generations, and one that draws on quintessentially American attitudes and practice.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Communities_of_innovation_-_Cyborganic_and_the_birth_of_networked_social_media.pdf,,"Cool, Jennifer Catharine.

But unlike oil, data are not a substance found in nature. It must be appropriated. The capture and processing of social data unfolds through a process we call data relations, which ensures the “natural” conversion of daily life into a data stream. The result is nothing less than a new social order, based on continuous tracking, and offering unprecedented new opportunities for social discrimination and behavioral influence. We propose that this process is best understood through the history of colonialism. Thus, data relations enact a new form of data colonialism, normalizing the exploitation of human beings through data, just as historic colonialism appropriated territory and resources and ruled subjects for profit. Data colonialism paves the way for a new stage of capitalism whose outlines we only glimpse: the capitalization of life without limit.",Library%202dd57658d61a4202910a21d7f4d329b9/Data_colonialism_-_rethinking_big_datas_relation_to_the_contemporary_subject.pdf,,"Couldry, Nick, and Ulises A.
